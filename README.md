## This is all about
The following web development is my new GitHub Website to introduce myself. This is Next.js + Twailind Css based development.


## Getting Started

```

Install dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```

Run development server:
```bash
npm run dev
```

```

## All about that...

I would like to thank Labubus for the inspiration.
